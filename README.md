Here is the deal.  

Case 1: 
Imagine you have been playing a video game with your pal. You guys are tired of playing against each other and you want to find
more pals to get better at the game. What if you could set a beacon on an 
interactive map that would say "Brothers, rise! Lets play smash. Come to my cave 
at 11th Ave ...". Brothers would rise indeed. Brothers would be able to chat
with you on a channel to make sure you are legit (and not a noob). You guys
will have such a good time. 

Case 2: 
You are tired of studying computer science all the time. You want to learn more
about Art ! So, you put a beacon on a cafe nearby saying "Rise people from the
Art world. Teach me your ways at Cafe Solstice. At whatever time, I am flexible.".
Artsy people will rise and touch you. They will be able to chat with you before
they come to you; there is no doubt that they will say "You have been corrupted 
by the machine. Let me save your soul.".

Case 3:
You lead a jujutsu organization with lots of people. You are about to have
your weekly event at a nearby gym. Since your organization has lots of people,
your beacon will glow more compared to others. You will be able to chat with
interested new-comers in a channel(room), encouraging them by saying "Don't worry
, anyone through hard work can become good at the art. Excited to see you."
