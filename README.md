Here is the deal.  

Case 1: 
Imagine you have been playing a video game with your pal. You guys are tired of playing against each other and you want to find
more pals to get better at the game. What if you could set a beacon on an 
interactive map that would say "Brothers, rise! Lets play smash. Come to my cave 
at 11th Ave ...". Brothers would rise indeed. Brothers would be able to chat
with you on a channel to make sure you are legit (and not a noob). You guys
will have such a good time. 

Case 2: 
You are tired of studying computer science all the time. You want to learn more
about Art ! So, you put a beacon on a cafe nearby saying "Rise people from the
Art world. Teach me your ways at Cafe Solstice. At whatever time, I am flexible.".
Artsy people will rise and touch you. They will be able to chat with you before
they come to you; there is no doubt that they will say "You have been corrupted 
by the machine. Let me save your soul.".

Case 3:
You lead a jujutsu organization with lots of people. You are about to have
your weekly event at a nearby gym. Since your organization has lots of people,
your beacon will glow more compared to others. You will be able to chat with
interested new-comers in a channel(room), encouraging them by saying "Don't worry
, anyone through hard work can become good at the art. Excited to see you."

# Setup

- [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    - Follow all steps :
        - Yes this means installing both Xcode and Android Studio
- [Setup Android Studio As Editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)
- Run `flutter Doctor` and fix all bugs
- Time to import stuff from Github.
    - File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git
    - Then enter the cloning url from Github
    - When the project has been imported, there will be a suggestion on the top
    saying `get dependencies`. Say yes to that. 
    - Now open up IOS emulator(Don't try Android yet) and run project on that.
    - If the project does not build, and you don't understand the error. Contact me asap.
    - Look at the get up to speed section now. Build a simple app.
    
Below is the list of files that we should NEVER check into github primarily because 
they are auto generated and some are just libraries. : 
```
.gradle/
.idea/
Cluster-test.iml
build.gradle
build/
gradle/
gradlew
gradlew.bat
ios/Pods/
local.properties
```

# Get up to speed
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

I recommend using Android Studio. 

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Also watch this below video to understand how easy it is to work with UI in flutter.
- [Lab: Flutter Widget position](https://fireship.io/lessons/flutter-widget-positioning-guide/)
Also watch the following series to understand Firestore. The Distributed NoSQL database
we will be using:
- [Firestore !!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_hR4K4auoQ&t=22s)
Read design_doc.md in root
I think you are now ready to dive in. Simply ask me questions if you don't understand some
concept.
